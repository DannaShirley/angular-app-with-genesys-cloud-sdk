## Contents

* [Solution components](#solution-components "Goes to the Solutions Components section")
* [Prerequisites](#prerequisites "Goes to the Prerequisites section")
* [Sample Angular app](#sample-angular-app "Goes to the Sample Angular app section")
* [Implementation steps](#implementation-steps "Goes to the Implementation steps section")
* [Additional resources](#additional-resources "Goes to the Additional resources section")

## Solution components

* **Genesys Cloud** - A suite of Genesys cloud services for enterprise-grade communications, collaboration, and contact center management. In this solution, a Genesys Cloud user account is required in order for the Angular app to be authorized to integrate with Genesys Cloud.
* **Angular CLI** - A command line tool that facilitates the use of the Angular development framework for building single-page applications. The sample app in this solution was built with Angular 12 CLI.

### Software development kit (SDK)

* **Genesys Cloud Platfrom API SDK** -  Client libraries used to simplify application integration with Genesys Cloud by handling low-level HTTP requests. In this solution, the SDK authorizes the user and performs the API calls required to execute the supervisor features.

## Prerequisites

### Specialized knowledge

* Administrator-level knowledge of Genesys Cloud
* Experience using the Genesys Cloud Platform API
* Experience using Angular or the Angular CLIÂ 

### Genesys Cloud account requirements

* A Genesys Cloud license. For more information on licensing, see [Genesys Cloud Pricing](https://www.genesys.com/pricing "Goes to the pricing page").
* (Recommended) The Master Admin role in Genesys Cloud. For more information, see [Roles and permissions overview](https://help.mypurecloud.com/?p=24360 "Opens the Roles and permissions overview article") in the Genesys Cloud Resource Center.

## Sample Angular app  

:::primary
**Note**: If you have an existing Angular project and only want to know how to configure Genesys Cloud SDK in your app, see [Implementation steps](#implementation-steps "Goes to the Implementation steps section").
:::

This solution includes a sample Angular app that uses the Genesys Cloud Javascript Platform SDK to display user data from Genesys Cloud.

![sampleapp.png]("The main page of the sample app")

 From the sample Angular app, a user can update some user data, and that updated data is returned to Genesys Cloud in real-time. Specifically:

***Prince, Please verify. I couldn't get the Queues list part to work--probably because I am not in any queues.***

* The **User** page displays details about the current user. It also contains a presence-picker component, which allows the user to change their presence or routing status.
* The **User Search** page allows the user to search for other users in their Genesys Cloud org.  
* The **Queues List** page allows the user to see Observation Query details for each queue. Within the Angular app, the user can log out all of the agents on a particular queue, which is helpful if those agents cannot log out of their stations after their shift is over.

### Genesys Cloud service

The sample Angular app includes the `genesys-cloud` service, which contains the Genesys Cloud-related functionality that is supported by the Angular app.

***Prince, do we need to clarify the distinction between a promise and an observable? Are the observables here the presence/statuses? Could you give a plain English (not code) example of what they could do with the observables after they convert them?***

All of the API methods return a promise, but if we want to work with observables instead, we can easily convert the promises by using the `from` operator. For example:

```typescript
  getUserDetails(id: string): Observable<platformClient.Models.User> {
    return from(this.usersApi.getUser(id, {
        expand: ['routingStatus', 'presence'],
      }));
  }
```

### Prepare your copy of the sample app

1. Clone the [blueprint repo](https://github.com/GenesysCloudBlueprints/angular-app-with-genesys-cloud-sdk "Goes to the blueprint repo in Github") to your local machine:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/GenesysCloudBlueprints/angular-app-with-genesys-cloud-sdk.git
  ```

2. Go to the **genesys-cloud-sample** project directory.

  ```bash
  cd genesys-cloud-sample
  ```

3. Modify the client ID and redirect URI values in the environment files.

  i. Go to the **src**>**environments** directory.

  ii. Modify the production `environment.prod.ts` file:

  ```typescript
  export const environment = {
    production: true,
    GENESYS_CLOUD_CLIENT_ID: '<YOUR CLIENT ID HERE>',
    REDIRECT_URI: '<YOUR PRODUCTION URI HERE>',
  };
  ```

  iii. Modify the test `environment.ts:` file:

  ```typescript
  export const environment = {
    production: false,
    GENESYS_CLOUD_CLIENT_ID: '<YOUR CLIENT ID HERE>',
    REDIRECT_URI: 'http://localhost:4200',
  };
  ```

### Run the sample app

***Prince I'm confused here... Didn't we just tell them how to prepare a local copy of the sample app? Why are we pointing them to the GitHub repo?***

:::primary
**Note**: In order to run the sample app, you need a Genesys Cloud user account.
:::

1.  Go to the [Sample app](https://genesyscloudblueprints.github.io/angular-app-with-genesys-cloud-sdk/).

2.  If you're on a different region than `us-east-1` (mypurecloud.com), add an `environment` query parameter to the URL and enter your Genesys Cloud [environment](https://developer.genesys.cloud/api/rest/). For example:

  ```bash
  https://genesyscloudblueprints.github.io/angular-app-with-genesys-cloud-sdk/?environment=mypurecloud.com.au
  ```

## Implementation steps

Follow these instructions to include the Genesys Cloud Javascript Platform SDK in your own Angular project.

### Create a Token Implicit Grant (Browser) client in Genesys Cloud

1. To authorize your app with the Genesys Cloud SDK, create an Implicit Grant (Browser) client with the following settings:

  * **Authorized redirect URIs (one per line)**:
    * Your production URI
    * `http://localhost:4200/` (to test locally)
  * **Scope**:
    * analytics
    * authorization
    * presence
    * routing
    * users

For more information, see [Create an OAuth client](https://help.mypurecloud.com/articles/create-an-oauth-client/ Goes to the Create an OAuth client article) in the Genesys Cloud Resource Center.

### Prepare Angular  

1. Install the Angular CLI:

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

2. Serve the Angular app locally:

```bash
ng serve
```

3. Create a new Angular 12 project:

```bash
ng new name-of-your-app
```
:::primary
**Tip**: Instead of creating a new Angular project, you can use an existing one. However, these instructions assume you're using Angular 12. If you use an earlier version of Angular, you may need to adapt these instructions.
:::

***Prince Do we need to say something more here... like "Put your code here..."***

### Install NPM packages

1. Install the Genesys Cloud platform client:

```bash
npm install purecloud-platform-client-v2
```

2. Install the custom-webpack library:

```bash
npm i @angular-builders/custom-webpack --save-dev
```

### Configure the files for platform client usage

***Prince: Better title? Ex: Configure the files for use with the Genesys Cloud Javascript Platform SDK***

1. In the root of your Angular project, create a file with a meaningful name. For example, `extra-webpack.config.js`

2. Add the following content to the file:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  externals: {
    'purecloud-platform-client-v2': "require('platformClient')",
  },
}
```

3. In the root of the project, open the `angular.json` file and find the `architect` property. Then modify the builder targets, which are found under the `build` property:

    i. Change the builder property to: `@angular-builders/custom-webpack:browser`

    ii. Under the options property, add a new `customWebpackConfig` object. Refer to the following code block for details.

    iii. In the `scripts` property add `node_modules/purecloud-platform-client-v2/dist/web-cjs/purecloud-platform-client-v2.min.js`

    Modified `build` property:

     ```json
      "build": {
        "builder": "@angular-builders/custom-webpack:browser",
        "options": {
          ...,
          "customWebpackConfig": {
            "path": "./extra-webpack.config.js",
            "mergeRules": { "externals": "prepend" }
          },
          "scripts": [..., "node_modules/purecloud-platform-client-v2/dist/web-cjs/purecloud-platform-client-v2.min.js"]
        }
      }

    ```

4. Modify the `serve` target:

      ```json
      "serve": {
        "builder": "@angular-builders/custom-webpack:dev-server",
        ...
      }
      ```
      :::primary
      **Tip**: The `serve` property uses the `options` configuration from `build`, so you don't need to change anything else here.
      :::

5. Modify the `test` property:

    i.  If you're using Karma for Angular testing, change the builder property to: `@angular-builders/custom-webpack:karma`.

    ii. Under the `options` property, add a new `customWebpackConfig` object. Refer to the following code block for details.

    iii. In the `scripts` property add `node_modules/purecloud-platform-client-v2/dist/web-cjs/purecloud-platform-client-v2.min.js`

    The modified `build` property should look something like this:

     ```json
      "build": {
        "builder": "@angular-builders/custom-webpack:karma",
        "options": {
          ...,
          "customWebpackConfig": {
            "path": "./extra-webpack.config.js",
            "mergeRules": { "externals": "prepend" }
          },
          "scripts": [..., "node_modules/purecloud-platform-client-v2/dist/web-cjs/purecloud-platform-client-v2.min.js"]
        }
      }

    ```

6. Finally, in your `tsconfig.json`, disable `noImplicitAny` in the `compilerOptions`:

  ```json
  {
    ...
    "compilerOptions": {
      ...
      "noImplicitAny": false,
    },
  }
  ```

### Import the platform-client-sdk to your Angular project

***Prince: Better title? Ex: Import the Genesys Cloud Javascript Platform SDK into your Angular project***

1. Import and use the Genesys Cloud platform client in your Angular code. For example:

```javascript
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import * as platformClient from 'purecloud-platform-client-v2';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
})
export class AppComponent implements OnInit {
  title = 'sample-app';
  ngOnInit() {
    console.log(platformClient);
  }
}
```
